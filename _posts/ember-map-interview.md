I recently gave an interview to the great folks at [EmberMap](https://www.embermap.com) about some of
the topics I will be talking about at my workshop at [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/schedule.html#b-eat-your-greens-a-broccoli-js-tutorial)
titled "Eat Your Greens: A Broccoli.js Tutorial".

In the video we cover some of the topics I will be discussing, along with the benefits of static analysis
 and static typing in your javascript applications. Check it out!
