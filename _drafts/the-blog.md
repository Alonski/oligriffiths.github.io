title: The Blog

So I finally got round to starting a blog. And you'd think that's a simple matter these days.

 There are many blogging tools and applications available, Wordpress, Joomla, Tumblr, Blogger, Ghost, etc. One thing I knew I didn't want was a hosted blog, 'cos, you know, I'm a developer and must have control over everything!

So Wordpress.com, Tumblr and Blogger were out. I knew I didn't want to have a costly hosting solution either and have to worry about uptime, server maintenance, etc, so Wordpress, Joomla, and so on were out. I turned my attention to Ghost since hearing about it's kick starter campaign so set about getting that installed on my local machine. Ghost is awesome. Super simple to setup, runs on node.js, looks pretty, write in markdown, themes, etc etc. Seemed perfect. The only thing is that it runs on node, this I would need a node hosting solution, and would likely still have to deal with uptime, bla bla bla.

 I'd also heard of Github pages, a free static hosting solution that turns a branch on a repository into a website. You can even have custom domain names. I like the sound of this, utilise Githubs infrastructure, perfect.
